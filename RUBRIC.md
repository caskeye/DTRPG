# Rubric Breakdown (Total 100 points)
## Due May 6, 11:59PM

### You are free to choose any project, as I have pointed out before, as long as they follow these rubrics. Any project will be based around a bunch of scenarios that are needed to create a useful system that uses AI methods. A successful project will create aspects of a system based on AI methods (LO1), demonstrate use of AI libraries and packages (LO2) and create a modular and well designed working system (LO3). 

1. **Base System Functionality (30 pts)**

      - The AI system runs without errors and can manage basic scenarios

          - Include a list of scenarios that your AI system is capable of handling in your report.

      - Ties to LO1 and LO3 by demonstrating fundamental AI concepts in a working system.

2. **Prompt Engineering and Model Parameter Choice(10 pts)**

      - Properly adjusting temperature, max tokens, or other parameters.

          - Explain rationale behind chosen settings for each scenario in your report.

      - Use of effective prompts to guide the LLMâ€™s behavior and narrative style.

      - Use of context, user instructions, or role-based prompts to improve responses.
            Mention the prompts used for handling scenarios in your report.

      - Shows a clear understanding of LO1.

3. **Tools Usage (15 pts)**

      - Demonstrates additional tool calling capabilities (dice rolls, web search, database, etc.) if relevant.

      - Strong link to LO1 and LO2 in identifying and integrating Python ecosystem resources.

4. **Planning & Reasoning (15 pts)**

      - Implements or demonstrates multi-step reasoning and planning (e.g., chain-of-thought models).

      - Enhances conversation coherence and performance.

      - Aligns with LO1 by showcasing AI concepts.

5. **RAG Implementation (10 pts)**

      - Uses a retrieval-augmented approach to maintain lore or context.

      - Data sources integrated thoughtfully to support scenarios.

      - Demonstrates advanced AI concepts, reinforcing LO1 and LO2.

6. **Additional Tools / Innovation (10 pts)** 

      - Use of at least one creative or optional add-ons (e.g., text-to-speech, NPC image generation).

      - Clearly explained and used effectively.
        Addresses LO2

7. **Code Quality & Modular Design (10 pts)**

      - Clean, well-documented, and modular Python code.

      - Demonstrates best practices in version control and environment management.

      - Directly tied to LO2 and LO3 through structured, maintainable implementation.


**Examples of Scenario Types for D&D:**
  
    -Tavern social encounters with diverse NPC dialogues.
    -Maintaining game state.
    -Dungeon exploration with descriptions of rooms, items, and traps.
    -Combat resolution (attack rolls, damage calculation, hit/miss   outcomes).
    -Complex NPC interactions (merchant bargaining, deceptive characters).
    -Detailed narration of player actions (stealth, persuasion attempts, lock-picking outcomes).
    -Automated dice rolls for skills, combat, and saves.
    -Real-time rules and spell effect lookups.
    -Monster stat and lore retrieval during encounters.
    -Coordinated enemy ambush planning.
    -Multi-stage puzzle solving and hint delivery.
    -Strategic enemy decisions (retreat, negotiation, flanking tactics).
    -Recalling past player interactions to inform NPC reactions.
    -Integrating previously established lore into current storytelling.
    -Tracking quest progress and updating narratives accordingly.
    -AI-generated NPC or monster portraits.
    -Voiced AI narration for dramatic storytelling.
    -Dynamic map generation based on player exploration.
